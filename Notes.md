# Notes

## Important Rules

- **Do NOT commit code changes automatically.** Always let the user review changes first and only commit when explicitly asked to do so.
- **Use snake_case for all code.** All functions and variables must be named using snake_case.
- **Write tests for all changes.** Any code changes must include tests, and tests must pass before claiming a task is complete.
- **Cross-project relationships:** The parser creates relationships into other projects by hard requirement. The relationship table can have caller/callee entities from different projects.
